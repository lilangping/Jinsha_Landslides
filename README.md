Comprehensive inventory of large landslides in the upper Jinsha River basin (Li et al., 2025, GSIS).

Landslide features including headscarps and bodies, as well as polygons of landside total affected areas were manually delineated using Google Earth.
Specifically, the headscarps and bodies of landslides were first mapped and then connected to form polygons that incorporate the failure, transition, and deposition zones.
Only landslide sites that preserve recognizable headcarps and bodies were mapped and inventoried, and those sites that do not preserve identifiable headcarps or bodies were excluded.
Landslides with a projected area smaller than 10,000 m2, which is equivalent to a 100 m × 100 m horizontal dimension, were also excluded from the final inventory.
A total of 122 large landsides were delineated, separately for their headscarp lines, body polygons, and polygons of the total affected area that incorporate the failure and transition-deposition zones.
In addition, landslide paths of every individual landslide were generated using the open software Automatic Landslide Path Analysis (ALPA), which also output several “path-dependent” landslide geometric parameters (Li et al., 2022, Landslides).

金沙江上游流域大型滑坡全面目录（Li et al., 2025, GSIS）。

基于谷歌地球平台，划定了包括滑坡后壁与滑坡堆积体在内的特征边界，以及滑坡影响范围的多边形区域。具体流程为：先标定滑坡后壁与滑坡堆积体边界，继而连接形成包含源区、流动区与堆积区的完整多边形。仅对保留有可识别后壁和滑坡堆积体的灾害点进行编目，无法辨识上述要素的滑坡点予以排除。同时，将投影面积小于1万平方米（即水平投影尺寸为100米×100米）的滑坡排除在最终编目之外。
共计解译划定122处大型滑坡，分别获取了其后壁边界线、滑坡堆积体体多边形以及包含源区与流动-堆积区的总影响区域多边形。
此外，采用开源软件ALPA（自动滑坡路径分析）生成了每个滑坡的运动路径，该软件同步输出多项"路径依赖"的滑坡几何参数（Li et al., 2022, Landslides）。
