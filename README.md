Comprehensive inventory of large landslides in the upper Jinsha River basin (Li et al., 2025, GSIS).

Landslide features including headscarps and bodies, as well as polygons of landside total affected areas were manually delineated using Google Earth.
Specifically, the headscarps and bodies of landslides were first mapped and then connected to form polygons that incorporate the failure, transition, and deposition zones.
Only landslide sites that preserve recognizable headcarps and bodies were mapped and inventoried, and those sites that do not preserve identifiable headcarps or bodies were excluded.
Landslides with a projected area smaller than 10,000 m2, which is equivalent to a 100 m × 100 m horizontal dimension, were also excluded from the final inventory.
A total of 122 large landsides were delineated, separately for their headscarp lines, body polygons, and polygons of the total affected area that incorporate the failure and transition-deposition zones.
In addition, landslide paths of every individual landslide were generated using the open software Automatic Landslide Path Analysis (ALPA), which also output several “path-dependent” landslide geometric parameters (Li et al., 2022, Landslides).
